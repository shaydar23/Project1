        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>The Purdue Building Accessibility Guide is powered by Purdue students. As accessbility on campus is constantly changing as elevators go out of order and Handicap Push Plates' batteries die on campus, and our mission is to help keep students informed about the accessibility, or lack thereof, on campus.</p>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Students that notice accessibility issues on campus should report them through the form that the DRC provides to resolve these issues. Then when they fill out the form, they can mark on the website which building and what specifically is down. While the issue is being resolved (this usually takes 2-3 weeks) students will be able to know beforehand about accessibility issues they may encounter on campus.</p>

        <h2>Report an Issue</h2>
        <button>Report</button>
        
        <h2>Latest Reports</h2>
